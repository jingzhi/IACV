    "### Projection geometry - the camera obscura\n",
    "When the diameter of the hole is sufficiently large compared to the wavelength of lighe, diffraction can be ignored and light may be assumed to follow a straight path. This is an example of a __pinhole camera model__ (camera aperture is described as a point and no lenses are used to focus light). Projection geomettry of thin lens is the same.\n",
    "* Place the camera hole at $O(0,0,0)$\n",
    "* Let a point on the object be $P_o(X_o,Y_o,Z_o)$. (by definition object coordinates are all positive)\n",
    "* Corresponding image point is $P_i(X_i,Y_i,-f)$, where f is the distance between image plane and the camera.\n",
    "* __linear magnification,m__ follows $$ m =-\\frac{X_i}{X_o}=-\\frac{Y_i}{Y_o}=\\frac{f}{Z_o}, $$ beware image coordinates are of opposite sign of corresponding object coordinates.\n",
    "* This image formation geometry is called __perspective projection__, describing the mathematical relationship between the coordinates of a point in three-dimensional space and its projection onto the image plane of an ideal pinhole camera. \n",
    "Limitation: small hole -> faint image; large hole -> unsharp image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thin lenses\n",
    "All lenses discussed in this chapter are for the \"thin lenses\".\n",
    "* Place center of the lens (optical center) at $O(0,0,0)$.\n",
    "* Let optical axis be Z-axis.\n",
    "* The projection geometry is unbroken but the imgage distance $Z_i$ is now fixed for a sharply focused image, which follows __Gauss's formula__ $$ \\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{Z_o}-\\frac{1}{Z_i}.$$ Here f is the focal length, the image distance where points at infiniy are focused. Note it is different from the notion f in camera obscura.\n",
    "* f is determined by the __lensmaker's formula__ \n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{f}=(\\frac{n_l}{n_s}-1) (\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{r'}),$$\n",
    "where r and r' are both taken to be postive (radii of curvature on both side).\n",
    "* magnification and image position of lense with fixed focal length f: $$m=\\frac{f}{Z_o-f}.$$ Higher f -> larger m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "1. the lens surfaces are sperical on both sides.\n",
    "2. the lens thickness is small comapred to its radii of curvature.\n",
    "3. incomming light rays make a small angle with the optical axis (paraxil approximation)\n",
    "4. the refractive index of the media is the same on both sides of the lens\n",
    "\n",
    "### The depth-of-field\n",
    "For fixed focal length f and image distance Zi, only objects at Zo fulfilling the Gauss's fomular will be sharply focused. In practise, a range of distances $Z_o^- <Z_o <Z_o^+$ can be accepted as sharp. Objects within this range is called _in focus_. $Z_o^+ - Z_o^-$ is the depth-of-field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus a point on the object can be considered as sharp when it is projected to a circle with diameter $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Z_o=\\Delta Z_o^+ +\\Delta Z_o^-$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Z_o^- = Z_o - Z_o^- = \\frac{Z_o(Z_o-f)}{Z_o+\\frac{fd}{b}-f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger d (bigger aperture) -> narrower depth-of-field<br>\n",
    "Small Dof -> sense of small objects (think about close-ups,tilt effects)<br>\n",
    "Large Dof -> sense of largde objects (think about sceneary pictures)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aberrations\n",
    "#### Geometrical aberrations\n",
    "Image distortions or degradations like blurring, remain small for paraxial rays (which underlies most of the formulas of geometrical optics)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Radial distortion (impt)\n",
    "\n",
    "Caused by a systematic variation of optical magnification when radially moving away from a the point called the center of distortion. In practice, the center of radial distortion can be assumed to coincide with the principal point wiich usually coincides with the center of image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since radial distortion is non-linear, it is modeled with Tyler expansion. Typicaly only even order terms play a role where the effectis symmetric around the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spherical aberration\n",
    "\n",
    "When paraxial rays do not converge at a single point. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Astugmatism\n",
    "#### Chromatic aberrations\n",
    "Results from different behaviour of different wavelengths, since refractive index is wavelength dependent.\n"
